Hands On Practice for VSAM =

1) Rename the PS Files used for Loading Data into your VSAM Files
   USERID.VSAM.*	to USERID.VSAM.EMPFILE1, EMPFILE2, etc.
2) Rename the PS File used for Downloading Data from VSAM Files
   USERID.VSAM.*	to USERID.VSAM.OUT1, OUT2, etc.
3) Retain your PDS - USERID.VSAM.JCLLIB
4) Delete all other Files that exist under USERID.VSAM.*
   D = Delete all PS Files
   DELETE = Delete all VSAM Files
5) Try out All the JCLs that we have created so far to do the following -
   - ESDS
	a. Create a ESDS
	b. Load Records into ESDS
	c. Download Records from ESDS to Output File or SPOOL using
	   SKIP, COUNT, FROMADDRESS, TOADDRESS
   - RRDS
	a. Create a RRDS
	b. Load Records into RRDS
	c. Download Records from RRDS to Output File or SPOOL using
	   SKIP, COUNT, FROMNUMBER, TONUMBER
   - KSDS
	a. Create a KSDS
	b. Load Records into KSDS
	c. Download Records from KSDS to Output File or SPOOL using
	   SKIP, COUNT, FROMKEY, TOKEY
	d. Use REUSE and/or REPLACE to see its effects
   - KSDS with AIX
	a. Define the Alternate Index
	b. BLDINDEX to Load Records
	c. Define the PATH

6) Try the LISTCAT Command
7) Try the VERIFY Command
8) Try the ALTER Command

Try the following as a VSAM Assignment:
Write a single JCL to create a Employee Master VSAM KSDS with 2 Alternate Index
on Location and Technology. The Steps involved are -
1) Create the Base Cluster
2) Arrange Records from Input File using Temporary File
3) Load Records into Base Cluster
4) Create the AIX on Location
5) Load Records into Location AIX
6) Create connection between Base Cluster and Location AIX
7) Create the AIX on Technology
8) Load Records into Technology AIX
9) Create connection between Base Cluster and Technology AIX

Run the above JCL so that -
a. All the 9 Steps in one execution to achieve the objective
b. If any Step Abends, try to RESTART the JCL to achieve the objective
