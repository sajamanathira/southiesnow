You need to Increment Earnings for New Joinees for a User Loc as follows -
B Sc Grads = Rs x/-
Engg Grads = Rs y/-
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
    EXEC SQL
	DECLARE EMP_CUR CURSOR FOR
	SELECT EMP_LOC, ENP_DESN, EMP_EARN, EMP_DEDN
	FROM  T01_EMPLOYEE-tABLE
	WHERE EMP_LOC = :WS-LOC
	AND   EMP_DESN IN ('BG', 'EG')
	FOR UPDATE OF EMP_EARN
    END-EXEC
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    EXEC SQL
	OPEN EMP_CUR
    END-EXEC
In a Loop
    EXEC SQL
	FETCH EMP_CUR INTO Host Variables
    END-EXEC
    IF EMP-DESG = 'BG'
	ADD AMOUNT-X TO EMP-EARN
    ELSE
	ADD AMOUNT-Y TO EMP-EARN
    END-IF
    EXEC SQL
	UPDATE	T01_EMPLOYEE_TABLE
	SET	EMP_EARN = :EMP-EARN
	WHERE	CURRENT OF EMP_CUR
    END-EXEC

Create the following 2 Tables -
1) Location Table - as before
2) Employee Table - as below
   CREATE TABLE T01_EMPLOYEE_TABLE
   (EMP_ID	CHAR(5) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    EMP_NAME	CHAR(15) ,
    EMP_LOC	CHAR(3),
    EMP_DESG	SMALLINT,
    EMP_EARN	DECIMAL(7,2),
    EMP_DEDN	DECIMAL(7,2))
    FOREIGN KEY(EMP_LOC) REFERENCES T01_LOCATION_TABLE(LOC_ID)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT)
    IN PATNIDB1.PATNITS1;
3) Location Table has 4 Rows for 'PUN', 'MUM', 'CHN' and 'BGL'
4) Insert Rows into the above Employee Table as below -
   - at least 8 Rows per Location, at least 2 per Designation(1, 2, 3 & 4)
   There should be a minimum of 32 Rows in the Employee Table
Program Specifications =
1) Accept Increment Percentages per Designation for a Location from the User
2) Update the Earnings & Deductions as -
  Earnings	= Earnings + Increment Percentage
  Deductions	= 10% of New Earnings

User Input will be given as follows -
//SYSIN DD *
LOCN1N2N3N4N5
/*
where LOC = Location Code
      N1  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 1
      N2  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 2
      N3  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 3
      N4  = Increment Percentage for Designation = 4
      N5  = Increment Percentage for Designation = Other

In SPUFI, do the following steps -
1) Create a Backup Table = Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE_BK
   which has the same structure as Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE
   CREATE Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE_BK
     LIKE Tnn_EMPLOYEE-TABLE
     IN   PATNIDB1.PATNITS1;
2) Run the following SQL in SPUFI
   INSERT INTO Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE_BK
     SELECT * FROM Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE; 
In your COBOL Program, write the following 2 SQLs in your INIT-PARA
INIT-PARA.
    EXEC SQL
	DELETE FROM Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE
    END-EXEC
    EXEC SQL
	INSERT INTO Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE
	SELECT * FROM Tnn_EMPLOYEE_TABLE_BK
    END-EXEC
