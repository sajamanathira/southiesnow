JCL Utilities that we have studied so far -
1) IEFBR14
It's an IBM supplied Dummy Utility Program used to Allocate as well as
Delete Datasets.

2) IEBGENER
It's an IBM supplied Utility Program used to copy contents of 1 PS
File to another. The DD Names to be used are given below -
SYSPRINT = It contains the Output Messages generated by the Utility
SYSUT1   = It Names the Input Dataset to be copied from
SYSUT2   = It Names the Output Dataset to be copied to
SYSIN    = It Names the Instream Data / Control Cards required for
	   reformatting records like Generate MAXFLDS and MAXNAME

3) IEBCOPY
It's an IBM supplied Utility Program used to copy Members from 1 PDS
to another PDS. The DD Names to be used are given below -
SYSPRINT = It contains the Output Messages generated by the Utility
SYSIN    = It Names the Instream Data / Control Cards required for
	   copying.
	   COPY INDD=<Input DD Name>,OUTDD=<Output DD Name>
	   SELECT MEMBERS=(List of Member Names to be copied)
	   OMIT MEMBERS=(List of Member Names to be omitted)

4) SORT
It's an IBM supplied Utility Program used to Sort as well as do the
following things. The DD Names to used are given below -
SYSOUT   = It contains the Output Messages generated by the Utility
SORTIN   = It Names the Input Dataset to be sorted from
SORTOUT  = It Names the Output Dataset to be sorted to
SORTWK00 = It Names the Work Datasets to be used for sorting
SYSIN    = It Names the Instream Data/Control Cards required for sorting.
           SORT FIELDS=COPY	 - Copied contents of SORTIN to SORTOUT
	   SORT FIELDS=(Start Pos,Length,Data Format,Sort Type)
	   with EQUALS /NOEQUALS - maintains Order of Duplicate records
					in Input
	   SUM FIELDS=NONE	 - eliminates the Duplicate records
	   SUM FIELDS=(Start Pos,Length,Data Format)
	   SKIPREC=n		 - leaves out the first n records for
					processing
	   STOPAFT=m		 - selects only m records for processing
	   INREC FIELDS=(Output Pos:Start Pos in Input,Length,.......)
		Formats the Input Records before Sorting
	   OUTREC FIELDS=(Output Pos:Start Pos in Input,Length,......)
		Formats the Output Records after Sorting
	   MERGE FIELDS=(Start Pos,Length,Data Format,Sort Type)
		Merges multiple Input Files which need to be individually Sorted

(WE WILL BE DOING MERGE FIELDS IN CLASS TOMORROW MORNING USING TEMPORARY FILES)
